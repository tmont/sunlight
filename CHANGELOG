	- new languages: sln, batch, Haskell (kind of, this language is really hard to understand by reading tutorials)

1.5 2011-04-22
--------------
- Bugfixes
	- fixed bug where keywords were being spuriously detected in idents (e.g. "class" in "cclass")
	  due to the fact that the regular expression in the generated hashmap was not requiring the match
	  to start at the beginning of the string (with "^")
	- made default number parser better (don't allow multiple decimal places, and don't allow decimal point
	  in octal/hex numbers)
	- fixed bug in C# attribute detection where it would falsely identify the namespace portion of a fully
	  qualified type name

	  in Java and C#

--------------
- Bugfixes
	- fixed bug in number parsing where decimals with more than one digit to the right of the decimal
	  point were not being parsed as numbers (oops)
	- fixed bug where code with trailing newlines had too many line numbers (more specifically, browsers
	  don't render the last trailing newline, so neither will we), doesn't work in IE6, too bad
- Enhancements
	- PHP class names after instanceof are highlighted as named idents
	- new languages: bash, tsql, python, ruby, java
	- added line highlighting via lineHighlight option

1.2 2011-04-09

- Bugfixes
	- C#
		- fixed false positive named ident detection for generics
		- custom named ident rules in threw errors if the first token of the string was an ident
		- attribute names weren't being recognized as named idents if it was the first  token

		- fixed named ident false positive for array access, e.g. foo.Bar[0].Name had "Bar" as a named ident
